QuickLook
=========

Developers can't make every app for everyone, so why not make it yourself.

Construct your own mobile web apps with an API and Quicklook. 
To try it out, open index.html. To start enter your API into the input at the top, or just hit go to use the default API based off of http://wishingwealthblog.com/.
Drag the info blocks you want onto the app, move them around until you are satisfied, then generate the code for your app.
For now, your webapp does require that you have a Jsfiddle account, but it's free. Sign up here http://jsfiddle.net/ for your free account.
